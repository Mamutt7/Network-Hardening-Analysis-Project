# Network Hardening Analysis Project (Scenario-Based)

This repository contains the **Network Hardening Analysis** project, developed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**. This project focuses on analyzing a simulated scenario to identify vulnerabilities and propose effective network hardening solutions to prevent data breaches.

## Project Overview

The project involves a **scenario-based exercise** where a social media organization suffers a significant data breach. The aim is to analyze the situation, identify the root causes, and recommend strategies to strengthen the organization's network security.

### Scenario Summary

- **Organization:** Social Media Company
- **Incident:** Major data breach compromising sensitive customer data (e.g., names, addresses).
- **Identified Vulnerabilities:**
  1. Employees share passwords.
  2. Admin password for the database is set to default.
  3. Firewalls lack traffic filtering rules.
  4. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not implemented.

## Objectives

1. **Security Risk Assessment**: 
   - Analyze the given vulnerabilities and their potential impact on the organization.
2. **Recommendations**: 
   - Propose up to three effective network hardening tools and methods.
   - Justify why these methods address the specific vulnerabilities.
3. **Preventative Measures**:
   - Explain how the proposed methods prevent future security incidents.

## Questions Addressed

1. **Which network hardening tools and methods are most suitable?**
2. **How do the proposed solutions address specific vulnerabilities?**
3. **Why are these solutions effective in managing risks?**
4. **How often should these practices be implemented?**

## Key Deliverables

### Recommended Solutions

1. **Multifactor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Protects user accounts from brute force and credential-stuffing attacks.
   - Effective because it adds an additional layer of verification beyond passwords.
   
2. **Firewall Maintenance**:
   - Ensures traffic filtering rules are in place to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Effective because it minimizes the attack surface and blocks malicious traffic.

3. **Password Policies**:
   - Enforces secure, unique passwords and eliminates default credentials.
   - Effective because it reduces the risk of password sharing and brute force attacks.

### Justifications and Explanations

- **MFA**: Implement once and maintain periodically. Enhances user authentication significantly.
- **Firewall Maintenance**: Regular updates (e.g., monthly or as needed) to adapt to evolving threats.
- **Password Policies**: Establish and enforce immediately, with annual reviews or as vulnerabilities are discovered.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

- Develop skills in analyzing cybersecurity scenarios.
- Understand the principles of network hardening.
- Gain experience recommending practical solutions for security issues.

## How to Use

1. **Review the Scenario**: Understand the vulnerabilities and challenges faced by the organization.
2. **Explore the Deliverables**: Review the proposed solutions and their explanations.
3. **Customize Recommendations**: Adapt these methods to similar scenarios or use them as a learning reference.
